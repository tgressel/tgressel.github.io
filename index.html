<h2> Our Mission:</h2>   
    <h3>UNIQUE Improv is dedicated to raising awareness and enhancing visibility for the disability community in the arts. We achieve this by offering a platform for individuals with disabilities to showcase their talents and share their stories on stage. Each of our shows features participants from various disability communities who perform improv scenes inspired by captivating monologues. Our ensemble of improvisers and guest monologists, consisting entirely entirely of individuals with disabilities, collectively strive to amplify the presence and consciousness of our communities.</h3>
