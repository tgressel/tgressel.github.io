    <h2> Our Mission:</h2>   

    <h3>UNIQUE Improv is dedicated to raising awareness and enhancing visibility 
        for the disability community in the arts. We achieve this by offering a platform 
        for individuals with disabilities to showcase their talents and share their stories on stage. 
        Each of our shows features participants from various disability communities who perform improv 
        scenes inspired by captivating monologues. Our ensemble of improvisers and guest monologists, 
        consisting entirely  entirely of individuals with disabilities, collectively strive to 
        amplify the presence and consciousness of our communities.</h3></div>
